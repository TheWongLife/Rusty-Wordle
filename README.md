### Project Introduction:
#### Description: 
A version of the fun & popular game Wordle in Rust. <br />

#### Goals & Objectives: <br />
Opportunity to incorporate advanced Rust concepts like borrowing, ownership, & structs into implementation. <br />
Recreate the fun & popular game of Wordle in Rust, where there are 6 tries to guess a 5 letter word. <br />

#### Why we chose to work on this project: <br />
Overall, it'd provide extra programming experience in the Rust programming language & would make for a fun & interesting final project to end the semester with. <br />

### System Overview:
#### Instructions:
1. Guess a 5 letter word. <br />
2. Each letter is marked a color after every guess. <br />
  - Green: The letter is in the answer & in the correct position. <br />
   - Yellow: The letter is in the answer but not in the correct position. <br />
    - Grey: The letter isn't in the answer at all. <br />
3. You lose if you fail to guess the word in 6 tries. <br />

### Possible Challenges:
Originally were planning to provide a website UI implementation utilizing CSS & HTML, but opted for a terminal-based output instead. <br />
